Course Description
----
This course covers the fundamental concepts and algorithms in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal is to process and understand text using statistical modeling and programming.

This course will start with basic text processing techniques (such as regular expressions and handling text encodings) and then cover advanced techniques (text classification and topic modeling). Finally, finish the course by applying Deep Learning to model text. Along the way we will touch upon text mining, information retrieval, and computational linguistics.

This is course is a "buffet" format, a sample of many things, but you will not get "full" on any one topic. People get a PhD in each of these individual topics. __Remember__ - a little bit of knowledge and a lot of "how to" goes a long way.

Guaranteed Topics
----

- Python - so much Python 🐍🐍🐍
- Text Processing
- Text Encoding
- Regular Expressions
- Segmenting, Tokenizing, & Stemming  
- Language Modeling - building statistical models of language use
- Word Tagging - Part of Speech (POS) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) 
- Text Classification - Sentiment Analysis  
- Topic Modeling - Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)  and Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) 
- Word Embeddings - word2vec, GloVe, doc2vec, ...
- Common packages - nltk, textblob, spacy, genism, fasttext
- Deep Learning - all in Keras (with TensorFlow backend), RNN, LSTM, CNN 

Possible Topics
----

- Chatbots
- Edit Distance
- Spell Correction
- Information Retrieval / Search Engineering
- Text summarization

Topics Not Included
-------

- Theory. We are only going to cover applied parts of NLP, aka tips n' tricks for getting stuff done.
- Grammar. Grammar kinda sucks but it is a very powerful method for understanding language.
- Non-English languages. I ❤️ other languages, and they are very important to understanding NLP. There is just enough not time!
- Machine Translation. Again very important and incredible breakthroughs have been made. There is not enough time to adequately cover it.
- Natural Language Understanding (NLU). Finding "meaning" in text. We'll spend most of our time focused on lower levels of processing.
- Natural Language Generation (NLG). We'll only going to briefly touch on how to programmatically create text during the Language Modeling section.
- Speech. In the last couple of years, speech-based language processing has revolutionized. For this class, we'll assume audio waves have been digitized into text.

Course Structure
-----

This course will be partly "[flipped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom)", basic lectures will be videos watched before class. In class lectures will be on complex topics and [active learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning)-style. You'll be writing a lot of code and completing many projects. The first 1/3 of the class will be small activities 5-15 minutes each. The middle 1/3 will be 2-day to 1-week projects. The last 1/3 will be working on a final project of your choosing.


Quotes from Past Students
-----

> - Brian is absolutely great. He's very knowledgeable and available for students. He knows how to explain material in a coherent and structured manner. He doesn't jump around from concept to concept without a proper introduction of the context. He gave me extra material when I showed deeper interest in the subject.

> - Brian's explanatory pictures have been savior.
  
> - Labs hand down have the most impact on my learning. It's only when you start implementing the concepts yourself on your computer that you come up with the best questions.

> - In the NLP class, the labs may be a struggle sometimes, but overall I think that exploratory learning process , trial and error style, is really helpful. Even if we don't feel productive, as long as there's an epiphany at the end of the minor struggle, it's all worth it.
