Course Description
----

This course covers the fundamental concepts and algorithms in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal is to process and understand text using statistical modeling and programming.

This course will start with basic text processing techniques (such as regular expressions) and then cover advanced techniques (text classification and topic modeling). The emphasis will be on contemporary best practices in industry, including Deep Learning and text embeddings. Along the way we will touch upon text mining, information retrieval, and computational linguistics.

This is course is a "buffet" format, a sample of many things, but you will not get "full" on any one topic. People get a PhD in each of these individual topics. __Remember__ - a little bit of knowledge and a lot of "how to" goes a long way.

Prerequisites
-----

- Working knowledge of probability (e.g., calculate conditional probability and apply Bayes Theorem)
- Basic statistics (e.g., the difference between pmf and pdf)
- One course in machine learning 
- Intermediate Python (e.g., the ability to create classes). I have found that the more Python a student knows the more NLP he/she learns during the course.

Learning Outcomes
-----

By the end of the course, you should be able to:  

1. Apply fundamental NLP concepts and algorithms to solve real-world problems
1. Write efficient code to process and model text data
1. Classify and cluster text documents
1. Create and use vector representations of words and documents
1. Build an end-to-end system to model meaning in text

Topics Not Included
-------

- Theory. We are only going to cover applied parts of NLP, aka tips n' tricks for getting stuff done.
- Grammar. Grammar kinda sucks but it is a very powerful method for understanding language.
- Non-English languages. I ❤️ other languages, and they are very important to understanding NLP. There is just enough not time!
- Machine Translation. Again very important and incredible breakthroughs have been made. There is not enough time to adequately cover it.
- Natural Language Understanding (NLU). Finding "meaning" in text. We'll spend most of our time focused on lower levels of processing.
- Natural Language Generation (NLG). We'll only going to briefly touch on how to programmatically create text during the Language Modeling section.
- Speech. In the last couple of years, speech-based language processing has revolutionized. For this class, we'll assume audio waves have been digitized into text.

Grades
----

| Item | Weight  |  
|:-------:|:------:|
| Participation | 30% | 
| Labs | 30% |
| Final Project | 40% |

Course grades range from “A” to “F.” The MSDS program considers a grade of "A" to represent exceptional work with respect to both the instructor's expectations and peer student achievements. A grade of "B" represents the expected outcome, what is called "competence" in a business setting. A "C" grade represents achievements lower than the instructor's expectations for competence in the subject. A grade of "F" represents little or no work in the course.

### Participation
You must also show up prepared. Each person is important to the dynamic of the class, and therefore students are required to participate in class activities. Expect to be "cold called". I call on students at random not to put you on the spot but to keep you engaged in the material at all times.

Attendance is mandatory. It is the responsibility of the student to attend all classes. If you have to miss class, due to sickness or other circumstances, please notify your instructor by Slack in advance. Supporting documents (doctor’s notes) should accompany absences due to sickness.

### Labs

The labs will be hands-on activities all in Jupyter Notebooks. They will require a combination of coding and self-reflection. The coding will be implementing algorithms from scratch or using common libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, nltk, and textblob). The self-reflection will be writing to explain a concept or apply a concept to new situation. 

### Final Project

Details will be covered in a future class (mostly likely the second class session).


__Course Structure__

This course will be partly "[flipped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom)", basic lectures will be videos watched before class. In class lectures will be on complex topics and [active learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning)-style. You'll be writing a lot of code and completing many projects. 

__Textbooks__

There are no required textbooks for this course. Preparation materials (e.g., videos, articles, and blog posts) will be assigned for each session. 

__Academic Integrity__

As a Jesuit institution committed to cura personalis — the care and education of the whole person — USF has an obligation to embody and foster the values of honesty and integrity. USF upholds the standards of honesty and integrity from all members of the academic community. All students are expected to know and adhere to the University's Honor Code. You can find the full text of the code online at www.usfca.edu/academic_integrity. The policy covers: 

- Plagiarism — intentionally or unintentionally representing the words or ideas of another person as your own; failure to properly cite references; manufacturing references.
- Working with another person when independent work is required.
- Submission of the same paper in more than one course without the specific permission of each instructor.
- Submitting a paper written by another person or obtained from the internet.
- The penalties for violation of the policy may include a failing grade on the assignment, a failing grade in the course, and/or a referral to the Academic Integrity Committee.

__Students with disabilities__
